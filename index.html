                            Hey Rockstars!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I'm Oliver (Ollie), the father of ChordConnect <i class="fa-solid fa-guitar fa-lg"></i> and I teach Rock-style.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Been a Rockstar all my life, thanks to my parents, who were both members of the famous British band "Ollie and the Sprites".
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Then, 2 years ago, I created ChordConnect with my old band mates to teach the next generation of mini-me's all the guitar knowledge I've collected over my headbangin' rockin' years.
                            <br>

                            Hello, Lovelies!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My name is Hazel, the non-stop poppin' and jivin' tutor at ChordConnect <i class="fa-solid fa-guitar fa-lg"></i> and I teach Jazz-style.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Jazz music was played endlessly on my father's vintage vinyl player when I was a kid.
                            "Jazz is the music of the soul", he taught me, and it's what shaped me into the person I am today.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It has helped me through both good and bad times, and I hope to share that feeling with you.

                            <br>
                            Prior to being dubbed "Guitarman", I was a HORRIBLE guitar player that I completely gave it up and told myself that, "it just wasn't my calling".
                            Until a friend recommended ChordConnect <i class="fa-solid fa-guitar fa-lg"></i> to me and the rest is history.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It may be frustrating now, but learning to play the guitar is highly rewarding.
                            <br>

                        "I've shocked so many friends and family with this new talent of mine!
                        I had originally signed up for another guitar course that was no longer available, so I searched the internet and ended up here.
                        It turned out to be a blessing in disguise!
                        The 2 free lessons for all first-time ChordConnectors were what really sold me as I was immediately connected to a tutor who was not only insightful but extremely engaging, making learning guitar a lot more enjoyable than I had anticipated.
                        The tutor also helps you assess your guitar skill level and from there, they deliver the most structured lessons."
