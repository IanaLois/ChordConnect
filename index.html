                    Hey Rockstars!
                    I'm Oliver (Ollie), the father of ChordConnect <i class="fa-solid fa-guitar fa-lg"></i> and I teach Rock-style.
                    Been a Rockstar all my life, thanks to my parents, who were both members of the famous British band "Ollie and the Sprites" and took me on all of their tours and shows.
                    Then, 2 years ago, I created ChordConnect with my old band mates to teach the next generation of mini-me's all the guitar knowledge I've collected over my headbangin' rockin' years.
                    ChordConnect with me and Rock on!

                <p> 
                    Hello, Lovelies!
                    My name is Hazel, the non-stop poppin' and jivin' tutor at ChordConnect <i class="fa-solid fa-guitar fa-lg"></i> and I teach Jazz-style.
                    Jazz music was played endlessly on my father's vintage vinyl player when I was a kid.
                    "Jazz is the music of the soul", he taught me, and it's what shaped me into the person I am today.
                    It has helped me through both good and bad times, and I hope to share that feeling with you.
                    ChordConnect with me and let's Boogie!

                <h3>Mason | The Gnarly Guitarman | Blues-style</h3>
                <p>
                    Yo, Newcomers!
                    The name's Mason, your friendly neighborhood Guitarman and I teach Blues-style. 
                    Prior to being dubbed "Guitarman", I was a HORRIBLE player of the instrument. 
                    At one point, I completely gave it up and told myself that, "it just wasn't my calling".
                    Until one hot summer day, a friend recommended ChordConnect <i class="fa-solid fa-guitar fa-lg"></i> to me and the rest is history.
                    It may be frustrating now, but learning to play the guitar is highly rewarding.
                    ChordConnect with me for your daily guitar fix!

                <p>
                    "Learning to play the guitar has never been easier.
                    It had been on my bucket list for years because I never had the time to learn it due to my extensive travel for work.
                    ChordConnect <i class="fa-solid fa-guitar fa-lg"></i>, on the other hand, is available to you no matter where you are in the world.
                    The tutors are accommodating when it comes to scheduling lessons and truly helpful at every stage of learning."

                <p>
                    "I want to be a great guitar player just like my Papá.
                    He bought me my first guitar on my 8th birthday but it was very hard to understand it; not even my Papá's teaching would work!
                    But then My Papá signed me up for ChordConnect <i class="fa-solid fa-guitar fa-lg"></i> and now I'm a master of so many guitar chords and songs.
                    I couldn't have done it without the teachers' kindness and patience with me.
                    My first performance will be at my school's talent show and I will become even better than Papá!"

                <h3>Krystal | 23 years old | Philippines</h3>
                <p>
                    "I've shocked so many friends and family with this new talent of mine!
                    I had originally signed up for another guitar course that was no longer available, so I searched the internet and ended up here, where I have never left. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise!
                    The 2 free lessons for all first-time ChordConnectors were what really sold me as I was immediately connected to a tutor who was not only insightful but extremely engaging, making learning guitar a lot more enjoyable than I had anticipated.
                    The tutor also helps you assess your guitar skill level and from there, they deliver the most structured lessons."
