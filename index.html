                        <br>
                        I'm Oliver (Ollie), the head tutor and founder of ChordConnect and I teach Rock-style.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Been a Rockstar all my life, all thanks to my parents who were both in the famous British band, "Ollie and the Sprites" and brought me along on all of their tours and shows.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Fast-forward to now, I built ChordConnect with my old bandmates to train the next generation of mini-me's all the guitar knowledge I've built up throughout my head-bangin' rockin' years.
                        <br>

                        Hello, Lovelies!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My name is Hazel, the free spirited tutor at ChordConnect and I teach Jazz-style.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Growing up, Jazz music was played non-stop on my father's vintage vinyl player.
                        He taught me that, "Jazz is the music of the soul" and it's what made me into the person I am today.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It's helped me through all the good times and bad and I hope to share that feeling with you.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Before I was deemed "Guitarman", I was actually TERRIBLE at playing the instrument. 
                        <br>
                        At one point, I completely gave it up and told myself that, "it just wasn't my calling".
                        Until one day, a friend recommended ChordConnect to me and the rest was history.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It may be frustrating now but learning guitar is absolutley rewarding.
                        <br>

                        It had been on my bucket list for years because I never had the time to learn it due to my extensive travel for work.

                        <br>
                        He bought me my first guitar on my 8th birthday but it was very hard to understand it; not even my Pap치's teaching would work!
                        But then My Pap치 signed me up for ChordConnect and now I'm a master of so many guitar chords and songs.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I couldn't have done it without the teachers' kindness and patience with me.
                        My first performance will be at my school's talent and I will become even better than my Pap치!"
